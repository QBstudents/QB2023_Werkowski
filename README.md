# QB2023_Werkowski
Quantitative Biodiversity course, Spring 2023, Indiana University
Anna Werkowski, awerkowski@iu.edu
Anna Werkowski is a first year PhD student in the Reynolds Lab. Prior to be accepted into the EEB program, Anna worked at DePauw University for two years working in alumni and event management as the Assistant Director of Alumni Engagement. She is much happier being back in school rather than working with stuffy old alumni. 
I expect over the course of this class to become more familiar with R, learn more about coding, become more familiar with biodiversity concepts, and feel more confident when explaining these concepts to other people.
